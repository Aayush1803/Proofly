# PROOFLY 🛡️

**Truth has a new guardian.**  
PROOFLY is India's most advanced, fully multimodal fact-checking platform. Engineered to counter regional misinformation across digital platforms like WhatsApp, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and YouTube, Proofly is the ultimate defense against fake news, deepfakes, and synthetic media. Built to handle complex code-mixed languages and deeply entrenched India-specific cultural contexts, Proofly detects, analyzes, cross-references, and debunks false claims in seconds using cutting-edge Generative AI.

## ⚡ Comprehensive Feature Suite

- **Omni-Channel Multimodal Inputs:** 
  - **Text:** Paste raw text, WhatsApp forwards, or social media excerpts.
  - **URLs:** Submit any public URL (News articles, Blogs, Reddit, Quora). Our intelligent scraping pipeline utilizes advanced semantic HTML extraction and YouTube Transcript TimedText API integration to extract pure context.
  - **Media Uploads:** Directly upload images, audio clips, video files, and PDF documents. The native multimodal pipeline handles Base64 extraction to seamlessly process media without relying on third-party OCR or disjointed transcribers.

- **Unmatched Multilingual Intelligence (23 Official Languages):** 
  - Proofly automatically detects and analyzes content across all 23 official Indian languages as mandated by the 8th Schedule of the Indian Constitution.
  - *Supported Languages:* Hindi, English, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Punjabi, Assamese, Maithili, Sanskrit, Kashmiri, Nepali, Sindhi, Konkani, Dogri, Manipuri, Bodo, and Santali.
  - Effectively parses complex Indian code-mixed formats such as Hinglish and Tanglish, interpreting regional slang and localized idioms.

- **The Deep-Dive 9-Step Pipeline:** 
  1. Input Collection
  2. Language & Modality Detection
  3. Factual Claim Extraction (Separating opinion from verifiable assertion)
  4. Advanced Logic & Knowledge Graph Cross-Referencing (Alt News, BOOM Live, Reuters, WHO)
  5. Manipulation Detection (Audio splicing, visual deepfakes)
  6. Virality Risk Scoring & Spread Prediction
  7. Regional & Cultural Contextualization
  8. Trust Score Generation (0-100 Confidence Index)
  9. ELI10 Explanation & Reporting

- **Frictionless Counter-Message Generation:** 
  - Instantly outputs a polite, highly localized, and factual counter-message explicitly formatted to be copied and forwarded directly into WhatsApp family groups or social media threads to fight fake news at its origin.

- **Premium 'Luxury-Technical' UI/UX:** 
  - A breathtaking, dark-themed user interface utilizing glassmorphism, Aurora Halo gradients, dynamic Framer Motion micro-animations, real-time pulse effects, and the ultra-modern Syne typography.

## 🛠️ The Architecture & Technology Stack

PROOFLY operates on a highly resilient, globally distributed serverless full-stack architecture designed for instantaneous latency and massive concurrent scaling.

- **Frontend & Core Framework:** 
  - **Next.js 14 (App Router):** Leveraging React Server Components (RSC) and Server Actions for highly optimized, SSR/SSG workflows.
  - **Styling & UI:** Tailwind CSS v4 paired with Framer Motion and Lucide React icons for fluid, GPU-accelerated interface rendering.

- **Authentication & Security:** 
  - **NextAuth.js (Auth.js):** Managing secure session states with deep Google OAuth2 SSO integration.
  - **Credentials Provider:** Custom email/password login fortified with `bcryptjs` (Cost Factor 12) for industry-standard cryptographic hashing.

- **Database & State Management:** 
  - **Neon Serverless Postgres:** Replacing legacy monolithic databases, Neon provides infinitely scalable PostgreSQL with true serverless auto-scaling and zero cold-boot latency.
  - **Prisma ORM:** Enforcing strict end-to-end type safety, automated schema migrations, and optimized connection pooling bridging the edge network and the Neon database.

- **Artificial Intelligence Engine:** 
  - **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash:** The core brain of Proofly. We bypass older fragmented NLP pipelines in favor of Gemini's native multimodal API (`GenerativeLanguage`). This allows Proofly to natively "see" videos and "hear" audio directly via inline Base64 streaming, ensuring maximum contextual awareness without hallucinations.

- **Advanced Web Scraping Engine:** 
  - **Cheerio & Fetch API:** A custom-built, highly intelligent pipeline that strips away web noise (ads, modals, trackers) to extract pristine article bodies using 15+ semantic HTML fallback selectors.
  - **YouTube API Hook:** Gracefully intercepts YouTube URLs to extract video titles, descriptions, and full TimedText XML captions natively.

- **Deployment & Hosting:** 
  - **Netlify Edge & Serverless Functions:** The entire application is deployed globally on Netlify. We utilize specialized `maxDuration` configurations (up to 60 seconds) to guarantee stability during heavy video and media processing. *(Note: Initially prototyped on Railway, the final architecture relies heavily on Netlify for seamless Next.js App Router API edge execution and Neon for distributed data).*

   # NextAuth Security
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="generate_a_secure_random_base64_string_here"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

   # Google OAuth SSO
   GOOGLE_ID="your_google_cloud_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
   GOOGLE_SECRET="your_google_cloud_client_secret"

   # Artificial Intelligence
   GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_2_5_flash_api_key"
   ```
